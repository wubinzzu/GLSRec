## **GLSRec**

This is our Tensorflow implementation for GLSRec and a part of baselines:

> Bin Wu, Yihao Tian, Xinxin Wu, Huan Zhang, Mingliang Xu.

## Environment Requirement

The code has been tested running under Python 3.8.10. The required packages are as follows:

- tensorflow == 1.14.0
- numpy == 1.19.5
- scipy == 1.4.1
- pandas == 1.3.1

## C++ evaluator

We have implemented C++ code to output metrics during and after training, which is much more efficient than python evaluator. It needs to be compiled first using the following command.

```
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

If the compilation is successful, the evaluator of cpp implementation will be called automatically. Otherwise, the evaluator of python implementation will be called.

## Examples to run GLSRec:

run [main.py](https://github.com/wubinzzu/GCARec/blob/main/main.py) in IDE or with command line:

```
python main.py
```
